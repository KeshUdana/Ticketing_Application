Multithreading:
Producers (Vendors):

Multiple vendors (Vendor 1, Vendor 2) are simultaneously adding tickets to the pool. Each vendor represents a separate thread acting as a producer.
Consumers (Users):

Users (User 0) are retrieving tickets concurrently. Each user operates in its own thread as a consumer.
Concurrency:

The interleaved logs of tickets being added and retrieved indicate concurrent execution of producer and consumer threads.
Producer-Consumer Pattern:
Shared Resource:

The ticket pool acts as the shared resource (bounded buffer) between producers and consumers.
Synchronization:

The output indicates that producers stop when all tickets are produced, and consumers stop after all tickets are consumed. This suggests that there is proper synchronization using mechanisms such as:
Locks/Mutexes to prevent race conditions.
Conditions or semaphores to manage when producers or consumers should wait (e.g., when the pool is full/empty).
Bounded Buffer:

The pool has a maximum capacity (max ticket capacity: 5), and producers/vendors respect this bound.
Rate Control:

The rates (vendor release rate: 2 and customer retrieval rate: 2) indicate that the program may also regulate the speed of production and consumption.
Evidence from the Logs:
Producers Adding Tickets:

plaintext
Copy code
Vendor Vendor 1 added ticket: Ticket{ticketID=0, ...}
Vendor Vendor 2 added ticket: Ticket{ticketID=0, ...}
Producers are actively creating tickets.

Consumers Retrieving Tickets:

plaintext
Copy code
User 0 retrieved ticket: Ticket{ticketID=0, ...}
Consumers are consuming tickets, sometimes back-to-back.

Handling Limits:

Producers stopped after producing all tickets:
plaintext
Copy code
Total tickets produced. Stopping producer: Vendor 1
Consumers stopped after consuming all tickets:
plaintext
Copy code
All tickets consumed. Stopping consumer: 0
Conclusion:
Your program indeed demonstrates multithreading and follows the producer-consumer pattern effectively. If you'd like, I can help verify or refine specific parts of your implementation, such as the synchronization mechanisms or thread management logic. Let me know!
