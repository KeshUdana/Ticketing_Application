For your use case, where you want a command-line interface (CLI) to prompt the system administrator to enter parameters at startup, and then use these parameters as a system-wide configuration in a concurrent, multi-threaded ticketing application, you can achieve this in Spring Boot by creating a startup configuration component. Here’s a structured approach that aligns with Spring Boot's lifecycle:

Create a Startup Component for CLI Input:

Use a Spring Boot @Component that prompts for input when the application starts. This component will save the user input in a configuration class or as beans.
Store Configuration Values:

Use a configuration class to hold the values entered by the administrator. This will make it easy to inject the configuration across various components in the application.
Global Access for OOP Tasks:

Since the configuration values are saved in a Spring-managed bean, they’ll be accessible system-wide, even in concurrent or multi-threaded tasks.
Here’s how you can set this up:

Step 1: Define a Configuration Class for the Input Parameters
java
Copy code
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class TicketingSystemConfig {
    private int numberOfTickets;
    private int maxThreads;

    public int getNumberOfTickets() {
        return numberOfTickets;
    }

    public void setNumberOfTickets(int numberOfTickets) {
        this.numberOfTickets = numberOfTickets;
    }

    public int getMaxThreads() {
        return maxThreads;
    }

    public void setMaxThreads(int maxThreads) {
        this.maxThreads = maxThreads;
    }
}
This class holds the configuration values for your system, such as numberOfTickets and maxThreads.

Step 2: Create a Startup Component to Prompt for Input
java
Copy code
import org.springframework.boot.CommandLineRunner;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

import java.util.Scanner;

@Component
public class CLIInputPrompt implements CommandLineRunner {

    private final TicketingSystemConfig config;

    public CLIInputPrompt(TicketingSystemConfig config) {
        this.config = config;
    }

    @Override
    public void run(String... args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter the number of tickets available: ");
        int numberOfTickets = scanner.nextInt();
        config.setNumberOfTickets(numberOfTickets);

        System.out.print("Enter the maximum number of concurrent threads: ");
        int maxThreads = scanner.nextInt();
        config.setMaxThreads(maxThreads);

        System.out.println("Configuration set successfully.");
        scanner.close();
    }
}
This component implements CommandLineRunner, which is a special Spring Boot interface that executes code after the application context has loaded but before the main application starts. It allows you to prompt for user input as soon as the application starts.

Step 3: Use the Configuration in Other Components
Now that the configuration values are set, you can inject TicketingSystemConfig wherever you need these values. For example, in a service that handles ticket processing:

java
Copy code
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class TicketService {

    private final TicketingSystemConfig config;

    public TicketService(TicketingSystemConfig config) {
        this.config = config;
    }

    public void processTickets() {
        System.out.println("Processing " + config.getNumberOfTickets() + " tickets with max "
                            + config.getMaxThreads() + " concurrent threads.");

        // Implement multi-threaded logic here using config.getMaxThreads()
    }
}
Explanation
TicketingSystemConfig: This acts as a central place for storing system configuration values entered by the administrator. It’s managed by Spring, making it available across the application.
CLIInputPrompt: This component runs on application startup and prompts the administrator for input. It then saves these inputs in TicketingSystemConfig.
TicketService: This service can now use the configuration values (numberOfTickets and maxThreads) for its tasks, including multi-threaded ticket processing.
Additional Notes
Concurrency Management: If you’re using threads, you may want to configure an ExecutorService in Spring that respects maxThreads as defined by the admin. Spring has @Async support and TaskExecutor beans for this purpose.
Error Handling: Consider adding error handling in case the admin inputs invalid values (e.g., non-integer values).
This setup allows you to initialize your platform with CLI input at startup, making the configuration globally accessible and adaptable to OOP principles in a multi-threaded environment.
