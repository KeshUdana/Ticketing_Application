Great progress with the CLI setup for system-wide configuration! Let’s clarify the variables you’ve implemented and outline the next steps for integrating them with the rest of your ticketing system.

### Recap: System-Wide Configuration Variables

Here’s a concise breakdown of each system-wide variable and its role in the multi-vendor ticketing platform:

1. **`totalTickets`**:
   - Represents the total number of tickets any **vendor** can allocate for their event.
   - This is a vendor-specific limit; each vendor can create up to `totalTickets` for a single event.

2. **`maxTicketCapacity`**:
   - Represents the **overall system limit** on the number of active tickets across all events and vendors in a session.
   - Ensures that the system doesn’t exceed a maximum load, balancing ticket availability across vendors.
   - The system will throttle new ticket releases from any vendor if this capacity is reached.

3. **`ticketReleaseRate`**:
   - Defines how frequently each vendor’s tickets are released from a holding area to an available queue.
   - This can be set per vendor event and is typically represented in a batch size or interval (e.g., releasing 10 tickets every second).
   - Ensures that tickets become available for purchase gradually, not all at once.

4. **`customerRetrievalRate`**:
   - Determines how often customers are allowed to purchase tickets from an event queue.
   - This can help regulate demand, preventing the system from getting overwhelmed by a surge of purchase requests.

With these configurations in mind, let’s outline the next steps.

### Next Steps

1. **Initialize Ticket and Event Management System**

   - **Create Ticket and Event Classes**:
     - Define classes for `Ticket`, `Event`, and `Vendor` to handle ticket information, vendor configurations, and event details.
     - Each event should have attributes for `totalTickets`, `releaseRate`, and `currentAvailableTickets`.

   - **Setup a Ticket Pool/Queue**:
     - Implement a ticket pool or queue for each event, managing how tickets are released based on `ticketReleaseRate`.
     - For simplicity, this can be a queue structure (like `ConcurrentLinkedQueue`) that manages tickets as they’re added and removed.

2. **Implement Multi-Threaded Ticket Release and Purchase System**

   - **Ticket Release Service**:
     - Create a scheduled task that releases tickets into the event queue according to the `ticketReleaseRate` for each vendor.
     - Ensure that this release respects `maxTicketCapacity` so that the system does not go over capacity.

   - **Customer Retrieval Service**:
     - Another task should allow customers to retrieve tickets based on the `customerRetrievalRate`.
     - This ensures that ticket purchases align with the configured retrieval rate, maintaining system stability.

3. **Concurrency Control**

   - Use synchronization mechanisms to handle concurrent access to shared resources (ticket queues).
   - Apply locks or synchronized blocks to ensure ticket count updates are thread-safe and to avoid overselling tickets.

4. **Logging and Monitoring**

   - Set up logging to monitor ticket release and purchase events in real time.
   - Log any errors, throttling events, and user activities to understand system performance and troubleshoot issues.

5. **REST API Integration with Spring Boot**

   - **Expose Endpoints for Ticket Operations**:
     - Build APIs to let vendors add events, view current ticket allocations, and monitor ticket release status.
     - Create endpoints for customers to view available tickets and complete purchases.

   - **Dashboard for System Monitoring**:
     - Consider a simple dashboard or CLI-based monitoring view showing active events, tickets released, and purchases in real time.

### Brief Example of the Flow

1. **CLI Configuration**:
   - System admin uses the CLI to set `maxTicketCapacity`, `totalTickets`, `ticketReleaseRate`, and `customerRetrievalRate`.

2. **Vendor Event Setup**:
   - Vendors create events, each with their `totalTickets` and `releaseRate`.

3. **Ticket Release Scheduler**:
   - Tickets are released gradually according to `ticketReleaseRate` while monitoring the overall `maxTicketCapacity`.

4. **Customer Purchases**:
   - Customers can retrieve tickets from the event queues as allowed by `customerRetrievalRate`, with VIP or prioritization rules if implemented.

With these steps, you’ll have the foundation for a multi-threaded, real-time ticketing system capable of handling multiple vendors and customers. This should make it flexible and scalable, with system-wide configuration keeping everything in balance.
